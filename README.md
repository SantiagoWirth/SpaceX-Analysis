# SpaceX-Analysis

SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars. Other providers cost upwards of 165 million dollars each. Much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. Spaces X’s Falcon 9 launch like regular rockets. The payload is enclosed in the fairings. Stage two, or the second stage, helps bring the payload to orbit, but most of the work is done by the first stage. This stage is quite large and expensive. Unlike other rocket providers, SpaceX's Falcon 9 can recover the first stage. Sometimes the first stage does not land. Sometimes it will crash. Other times, Space X will sacrifice the first stage due to the mission parameters like payload, orbit, and customer. In this analysis, i'm taking the role of a data scientist working for a new rocket company, SpaceY, that would like to compete with SpaceX founded by Billionaire industrialist Allon Musk. My job is to determine the price of each launch. I will do this by gathering information about Space X and creating dashboards for my team. I will also determine if SpaceX will reuse the first stage. Instead of using rocket science to determine if the first stage will land successfully, I will train a machine learning model and use public information to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.
